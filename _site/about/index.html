<p><img src="/assets/me4.jpg" alt="map" /></p>

<p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles but chose to go to the east coast for college. In May 2017 I received a BA in Mathematics with a focus in Statistics from Boston University.</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is an interest in astronomy. This prompted me to take an introductory astronomy course my first semester at BU, which ultimately led to my interest in math and statistics. I was also a member of the Boston University Astronomical Society and was even able to get away from the city to go star gazing in rural Massachusetts with the club.</p>

<p>Another one of my hobbies is racquetball which I’ve been playing since high school. I continued to play at school by taking sport classes. During my four years at school I also enjoyed classes learning tennis, yoga, kickboxing, and salsa dancing.</p>

<p>One of my favorite hobby is to travel. To me traveling is the most exciting way to push personal boundaries. After finishing high school, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to continue studying French in Paris during a 6-week immersion program at the American University of Paris. Afterwards, while most of my peers were beginning college I worked as an Au Pair in Rome for three months. The Boston University College of General Studies program I was accepted into commenced in the spring so it gave me the time in the fall to enjoy my Au Pair experience. The program also offered a summer semester abroad in London with an intensive curriculum.</p>

<p>Following graduation, I relocated to the Salt Lake City area to begin a career in the field of my greatest hobby, statistics.</p>
