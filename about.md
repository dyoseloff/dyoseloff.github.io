I was born and raised in Los Angeles so when the time came for college I wanted to go to the east coast to experience seasons. Four years later, I have a BA in Mathematics with a focus in Statistics from Boston University. After those four years I wanted share my work in one place so it could be of use to others and myself to refer back to. I share topics I found very interesting, techniques that were time consuming to figure out, and larger accomplishments. 

For fun I like to play racquetball, hike, play board games, and travel. The photo above is from a trip visiting family in Amsterdam.
